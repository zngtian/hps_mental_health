* Overview

The coding development of the project contains three modules:
- The [[file:build][build]] module :: This module contains the code for data curation.
- The [[file:analysis][analysis]] module :: This module contains the code for any analysis, including
  exploratory analysis, regression analysis, etc.
- The [[file:report][report]] module :: This module contains Rmd files for reporting.


* The [[file:build][build]] module

** [[file:build/initiate.R][initiate.R]]

This file sets up the =build= module. It performs the following tasks
- Loading packages. If a package is not installed, it will install it.
- Making directories: =input_data= and =output_data=
  - [[file:build/input_data][input_data]] :: It contains all raw datasets.
  - [[file:build/output_data][output_data]]  :: It contains all datasets from the code in this module that
    will be used in the ~analysis~ module.


** [[file:build/functions.R][functions.R]]

This file contains the functions that could be used repeatedly in the project.


** [[file:build/compute_mental_state_variables.R][compute_mental_state_variables.R]]

This script calculates the state-level mental health variables. Currently, we
include the following variables
- ~anxious~
- ~worry~
- ~interest~
- ~down~
- ~expctloss~
- ~curfoodsuf~
- ~tenure~
- ~mortconf~

The output of this script are currently two csv files, one
- =output_data/mental_state_origcateg.csv=: It contains the original variables with the
  original categories. New variables are the count, ratio, and total of the HPS variables.
- =output_data/mental_state_aggcateg.csv=: It contains the new variables with
  the aggregated categories.

** [[file:build/compute_phq_scores.R][compute_phq_scores.R]]

This script calculates the PHQ scores for mental health.

The output of this script is a csv file, =output_data/phq_individual_level.csv=.
